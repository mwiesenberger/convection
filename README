Two-dimensional interactive Rayleigh-Benard convection 
======================================================

The idea is to control a heat source in the convection cell
via a natural user interface.

In this program a webcam tracks a red or blue ball. The ball position is used
to place a source into the convection cell and the color determines its sign. 

The numerical part is based on the toefl spectral library, 
which is part of FELTOR
http://www.github.com/mwiesenberger/feltor
and uses fftw
http://www.fftw.org

The GUI is written with QT5 
http://qt-project.org/
and the computer vision algorithms are provided by OpenCV
http://opencv.org/
